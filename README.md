# <h1> Nessus Lab Vulnerability Management </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<b>In this vulnerability management lab where we will install Nessus Essentials in a vmware workstation player and set up Windows 10, inside of a vm install an old deprecated software on it and then we're going to be doing some vulnerability scans against that virtual machine to discover any vulnerabilities that might be on there and then we're going to go ahead and remediate one or two of those just so we can observe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Undersanding what is vulnerability management? Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting on security vulnerabilities in systems and the software that runs on them.
<br />
<br />
